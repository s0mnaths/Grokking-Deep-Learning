# Grokking Deep Learning

This repo contains the notes I made when reading the book *Grokking Deep Learning* by Andrew Trask.

If you are interested in the book, this repo might be useful. 

[Here](https://github.com/iamtrask/Grokking-Deep-Learning) is the repo of all the codes in the book by the author.
